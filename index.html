        <h4 class="welcome">Welcome to this daily devotion. Whether today finds you in a season of healing, waiting, growth, or celebration this 
           space was created with you in mind.Each day, you'll find a short devotion rooted in scripture, truth, and encouragement 
           to help guide your steps and strengthen your spirit. This isn't about perfection. It's about progress. It's about staying
           connected to God through every high, low, and in between moment of life.
           These reflections came from my own journey times when I had to hold onto faith, even when everything around me was shifting.
           My hope is that as you read, you feel uplifted, seen, and reminded that God is walking this path with you, every single day.
           This devotion is your daily check-in with your soul. A time to pause, pray, and press forward in purpose. Let it be your 
           reminder that no matter what the day holds, grace is available, strength is promised, and you are never alone.
           Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey.
           With love and purpose, <br><br>
